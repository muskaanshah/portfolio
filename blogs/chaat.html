                Whether you are hungry or not, there’s always space for chaat in your tummy. One such amazing place for
                chaat is the Vaishnavaas chaat house located on Ormes road in Kilpauk. This place is more than 20 years
                old. It’s a very small joint and could be a tough spot on the move as it doesn’t have any fancy
                hoardings. The Pani Puri, sandwiches and puff here is to die for. Adding on to this is the masala thumbs
                up.<br>
                Murukku cheese sandwich- Personally my favourite dish here. This is a hit in this store since almost
                everyone ordered a plate of it. It has a generous amount of grated cheese, veggies in between small,
                crunchy murukkus. This is legit my go-to dish and I can have it at any time of the day.

            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">Cheese bhujia puff - Cheese with bhujia? Two of my
                favourite items together. The puff is grilled a bit and has an amazing taste. I can have chaat at any
                time of the day, 24/7 and this dish is a necessity.</p>

            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">Khakra sandwich- A new dish which is gaining a lot of
                popularity now a days. It has capsicum, cucumber, tomato and onions chopped and mixed along with
                mayonnaise and placed between two cheese khakras spread with chutney. It has a yummy taste and a must
                try for those who haven’t tried it yet.</p>

            <p class="text-justify pb-5" style="font-size: 105%;">Overall I’d rate this place a 3.5/5. Do visit this
                place if you haven’t because the chaat is yumm. And if you have, don’t forget to drop in your favourite
                dish in the comments section.<br><br>~Muskaan Shah
