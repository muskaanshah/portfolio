            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">MOM! The first thing that comes to our mind when we
                here this three letter word is our mother. Well, there’s another expansion of MOM. Makers of milkshake
                (MOM) are always known for their taste and the consistency of the shakes that they provide. A friendly
                place with friendly staff will make you visit it again and again. This place is one of that kind. It’s a
                pleasant place to hangout and it has a nice ambience. There are beanbags and swings placed everywhere.
                It has great aesthetics with a pool table, other board games and a decent parking lot as well. With
                respect to their prices, they sell unique and signature shakes at a consistent price. It has a variety
                of milkshakes. This place would definitely satisfy anyone’s sweet tooth cravings. There are around 8
                branches. I visited the Kodambakkam outlet.<br>
                Belgian dark chocolate milkshake- I went for it since since it was marked as one of their bestsellers.
                Though it wasn’t phenomenal, it was super smooth, sweet and was teasing the tongue with its dark
                chocolate touch. Definitely a stiff competitor for the shakes in Thick Shake Factory, Keventers or
                Macca.

            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">Butterscotch milkshake- Add-on with choco chips.
                Typical scotch flavour with its conventional caramel crunches all around. It wasn’t completely shaken
                and had settled in scoops underneath.</p>

            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">Oreo Go Nuts shake- The best I had tried until now at
                this place. The Oreo was ground well with peanut taste all around. There was no coarse texture and it
                was smooth till the end.</p>

            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">Nutella shake- Thick, very slurpy, expected a Nutella
                domination but the taste of the add ons took the front seat.</p>

            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">Chocolate brownie shake- Beaten to powder choc
                brownie, well mixed with the chocolate shake. A little coarse but thick and beatific.</p>

            <p class="text-justify pb-5" style="font-size: 105%;">This place is very environment friendly and silent.
                I’d give this place a 4.7/5 and would strongly recommend y’all to go and try their milkshakes. If you’ve
                already visited this place, don’t forget to drop in your favouritest shake and if not do visit it and
