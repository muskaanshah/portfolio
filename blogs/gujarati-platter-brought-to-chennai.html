            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">One of the most famous North Indian breakfast is
                obviously the Gujarati food. A plate which includes delicious varieties like Dhokla, Khandvi, Jalebi
                Fafda with Papaya Masala. Itâ€™s a feast in the morning to devour it. A Sunday morning in my house without
                these dishes is totally incomplete. These dishes are enjoyed by all age groups.<br>
                Ajabs Mithai Ghar in Chennai is one of the famous places to enjoy this delightful Gujarati cuisine. Itâ€™s
                located in Alagappa road which is near purusaiwalkam.

            <p class="text-justify pb-5" style="font-size: 105%;">Dhoklas which are very spongy and juicy, are made with
                the batter of rice gram and chickpeas and looks yellow in colour. It is garnished with mustard seeds,
                sesame seeds, curry leaves, green chillies, coriander and grated with coconut which is optional. It is
                served with coriander and mint chutney. Khandvi is the tightly rolled bite sized pieces made out of gram
                flour and yogurt. Itâ€™s is seasoned with a little oil, mustard seeds, sesame seeds, curry leaves and
                green chillies. Coriander leaves add up to make Khandvi more delicious. Next, the Jalebis have itâ€™s
                origin from Western Asia and India. It is made by deep frying maida flour batter which moves in circular
                motion to it the shape and is soaked in sugar syrup. I personally love thin and crisp jalebis. It can be
                eaten plain or served with rabdi which makes it sweeter and is an amazing dessert. It can also be served
                with fafda. Fafda is the crispy papad like snack of Gujarat mainly. It is basically made of gram flour,
                oil, papad khar and carom seeds and is deep fried until it turns out to be crispy. Moreover, it is
                served with the papaya masala which is more like a chutney to eat with which makes it more yummy. The
                combination of Jalebi and Fafda is like sweets and savouries fulfilling your taste buds completely.<br>
                The Gujarati platter is very famous among the north Indians but not many south Indians know about this.
                All these dishes are a must try for everyone. If youâ€™ve already eaten all of these, do comment and let
                me know which is your favourite among these and if not, do try them all and drop in how was your first
                experience.<br>
                Personally, my favourite is fafda with papaya masala ðŸ˜‹<br><br>
