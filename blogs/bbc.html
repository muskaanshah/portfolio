            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">Ever thought of eating thayir saadam in the form of
                flitters? You heard it right, Broken Bridge cafe in Chennai serves such kind of fusions. It is located
                in RA Puram. According to me, this is Chennaiâ€™s best fusion restaurant. The food is excellent. I hate to
                my heartâ€™s content. It had been a very long time since I had an excellent brunch with so much to choose
                from until I visited Broken Bridge cafe. Some of the dishes left me stunned. I mean have you ever even
                heard of weird combinations such as thayir saadam flitters? Or Chicken Makhni papad? Or Rasam
                buttermilk? Or even Gulab jamun creme brulee tarts? I canâ€™t wait to get back to the place and try the
                stuff I couldnâ€™t get to try this time. Their presentation is so good and the staff here is extremely
                courteous and friendly. I love BBC.<br>
                Thayir saadam flitters- this dish is a never-heard-before-combination served with a sauce which adds on
                to the taste. I couldnâ€™t have even imagined a dish like this. And thereâ€™s this authentic taste of curd
                rice (thayir saadam)
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">Rasam buttermilk and paan flavoured lassi- Rasam and
                buttermilk? Totally opposite. But opposites attract and combining them together was definitely a great
                choice. Paan flavoured lassi had an amazing paan smell and flavour in it.</p>

            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">Vegetable fontina kulcha melt- Kulcha stuffed with
                cooked vegetables is an amazing new combination. It is served with two different types of sauces which
                enhances the taste of these kulchas.</p>

                lover? You should definitely try this. The pulao and the paneer tikka masala both are loaded with
                garlic.</p>

            <p class="text-justify pb-5" style="font-size: 105%;">Iâ€™d definitely give this place a 5/5 and recommend you
                all to go try this place. Itâ€™s a feast for all food lovers. And if you visit this place, donâ€™t forget to
