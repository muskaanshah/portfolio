                beach, munching on burnt corn with the wind passing through and a beautiful view? Well, the perfect spot
                for the same is a beach. Infact a not-so-crowded beach. Last week I visited this the N4 beach. It’s a
                harbour located in Kasimedu, north of Chennai. It’s not a very popular beach so there weren’t a lot of
                people which actually helped me calm my mind and also gave me a relaxing vibe. A cool breeze blew and
                along with this breeze came tiny bits of salty sand blowing all over the place. There are a variety of
                colourful boats and huge stones where people sit, gazing at the gentle sea. Listening to calm music just
                adds on to the beauty of the beach.

            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">There aren’t a lot of food stalls, but there
                definitely is one corn and raw mango stall, without which a beach is incomplete. This corn locally known
                as bhutta is roasted on the sigree and is flavoured with lemon and masala. These road side stalls give a
                different kind of satisfaction and has better food and gives a better experience than any big
                restaurants that we know of.</p>

            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">What could be more satisfying than watching the sunset
                on a beach? The ocean water, mirroring the sky colours looks serene and gives a very alluring view. I
                wish there was a pause button so I could watch this appealing sunset all day.</p>

            <p class="text-justify pb-5" style="font-size: 105%;">A day spent on the beach is definitely a well spent
                day! Being a Chennaite, if you haven’t visited this place, then you’ve surely missed on the nature’s
                aura.<br><br>
                If you’ve already been to this place, do drop in your reviews and if not this is surely a must
                visit!<br><br>~Muskaan Shah
