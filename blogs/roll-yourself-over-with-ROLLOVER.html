            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">Ice-cream rolls or handcrafted ice-creams are a new
                trend which is gaining a lot of popularity. It’s a feast at the end of the day to see it being made and
                then devour it. Ice-cream rolls gives people a chance to mix their favorite ingredients up until the
                last minute. Ingredients like dry fruits, chocolates, Oreos, sweet sauces etc.<br>
                One of the famous places in Chennai which serves amazing ice-cream rolls is Rollover located in Anna
                Nagar. They’ve got plenty of mouth watering choices to choose from. The creamy milk of the customer’s
                choice is poured on a cold pan and is crafted with ingredients of the same. These ice creams look and
                infact taste so yummy that it’s very difficult to stop with just one.

            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">This chocolate ice cream roll was served on a
                rectangular plate which consisted of four rolls along with a chocolate brownie and a chocolate syrup.
                The nuts on the rolls added on to the yummy chocolate rolls. This is one of the signature dishes in the
                menu.</p>

            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">The second was a vanilla fruit ice cream roll served
                on a waffle with strawberry crush on it.</p>

            <p class="text-justify pb-5" style="font-size: 105%;">This one is the best for people who like chocolate but
                are not chocolate lovers. Basically it has a perfect taste and blend of chocolate which doesn’t make it
                too chocolatey and the sprinkles on top just add on to the flavour making it a perfect ice cream.
                Personally, this is my favourite one.<br><br>
                Rollover is definitely a must visit for every ice cream lover. Is there a better place than this to have
                ice cream rolls at? I don’t think so. I’d rate this place 4.4/5.<br>
                If you have visited this place earlier, do drop your reviews and if you’re planning to visit it sooner
                or later, don’t forget to try the new paan flavour.<br><br>~Muskaan Shah
