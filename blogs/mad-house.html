            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">Reliving childhood and playing board games is the
                basic motive of M.A.D. House. This is my go-to restaurant for literally anything. This restaurant is
                located on the Kilpauk Garden Road. They have a nice ambience with swings and a small rooftop where you
                can just go and chill while the food is getting prepared. In addition to this, they also have a variety
                of board games and cards. You know a name a game and it’ll be there. The food is also pretty good. The
                portion size isn’t too big and serves 2 perfectly. Just that the dishes take a lot of time to get
                prepared. Theresa a small tea lounge and ice cream shop adjoining the restaurant.<br>
                Mix pasta- This pasta is literally the best pasta you would have ever eaten. It’s perfect for those who
                like both red and white sauce. It’s neither too tangy, nor too cheesy.

            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">Brownie with ice cream- Vanilla and chocolate? Perfect
                combination. Like how a meal is incomplete without a dessert, M.A.D. House is incomplete without this
                dish. This is one of the signature desserts of this cafe and it tastes amazing. The hot brownie just
                melts in your mouth and it feels like heaven.</p>
