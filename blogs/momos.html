            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">Imagine a steamed juicy stuffing of chicken or
                vegetables that come wrapped in a flimsy exterior of the finest flour, in a bamboo basket. I bet you
                drooled merely by the thought of it. Oh yes, momos are real and so appetizing. They are supposed to be
                originated from Nepal and Tibet. They can be steamed or fried, it depends on your choice. Two of the
                best places for momos in Chennai is Wow momo and Asian station.<br>
                The first one is from Asian station. They taste as delicious as they look. These are the authentic
                momos. They are steamed and filled with vegetables such as cabbage, carrot, beans and chunks of paneer.
                The banana leaf not only adds to the looks but gives another flavour too. The coriander leaves make
                these momos irresistible. The bamboo basket is a tradition followed in China. It helps in keeping the
                momos hot. These momos are served with a hot and sour sauce and red chutney whose ingredients are
                unknown.

            <p class="text-justify pb-5" style="font-size: 105%;">The second place where I had momos is from Wow momo.
                These are also steamed like the previous one and filled with paneer and corn. These are topped with
                french beans and spring onions which enhances the taste of these momos. They are also served with salsa
                sauce which makes it yummy and gives a tangy taste which complements the plain spiceless momos.<br><br>
                Not a lot of people have actually tried momos. Trust me, momos are really tasty and delicious. Along
                with this, it’s a bit healthy also as it has vegetables and aren’t fried. If you haven’t eaten momos, do
                try them. I’m sure you’ll love it. Don’t forget to drop in your favourite momo stuffing and if it’s your
                first experience, you can always share it in the comments option below!<br><br>
