            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">Being a North Indian who lives in Chennai, I have a
                specific liking towards south indian food and especially if it’s a little different from the usual idly
                dosa. When I found out there’s a place called ‘Eating Circles’ which serves Bengaluru style sambhar,
                which is a little sweet with a bit of jaggery, I couldn’t wait to go and try it out! This restaurant is
                setup on the Poonamallee high road and has become really very famous for its variety of South Indian
                food items and the sambhar, of course. This restaurant provides a Karnataka based cuisine with very
                different items.<br>
                I went along with one of my friends and the first dish we ordered was malgapudi thattu idly. This idly
                is not like the usual ones. It’s a little larger, softer and fluffier and the taste is also very
                different. It is topped with gun powder locally known as malgapudi. It is served with sambhar coconut
                chutney and tomato chutney. It was a treat eating this dish.

            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">The second dish which we ordered was a special butter
                dosa. It was filled with butter and had an amazing taste. We specifically told them to make it crisp.
                The dosa was served with sambhar, coconut chutney and tomato chutney.</p>

            <p class="text-justify pb-5" style="font-size: 105%;">Since we were only two of us, our tummies were already
                full. This is a drool worthy spot and is a must try for every south indian looking for soulful food and
                the prices are also very reasonable. I’d rate this place 4/5. If you’ve already visited it, drop in your
                favourite food item so that I can try it out during my next visit and if you’re planning to visit it, do
                try out the neer dosa and Kaju rose milk as well and let me know which you loved the
                most.<br><br>~Muskaan Shah</p>
