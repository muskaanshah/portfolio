                it’s a beautiful combination having a North Indian and a South Indian dish together. This weirdly
                awesome combination is served at Novelty tea house. Apart from being one of the most famous restaurants
                in Chennai, it is also one of the oldest. The crowded narrow streets of sowcarpet are filled with the
                smell of the dishes from this eatout. It is specially known for it’s pav bhaji, variety of dosas and
                masala tea.<br>
                The first dish is sizzling hot cheese pav bhaji. The bhaji is filled with chesse which adds on to the
                taste of the bhaji. The pav is loaded with butter which makes it even more soft and gives an amazing
                taste. The chopped onions also add on to the crispiness of the pav. Novelty’s pav bhaji is the best in
                the city. There’s some special ingredient which distinguishes this pav bhaji from the rest.

            <p class="text-justify pb-3" style="font-size: 105%;">The second is cheese pudina dosa. Ever had pudina with
                dosa loaded with cheese? Definitely one of the best varieties of dosa. This dosa is served with two
                chutneys- coconut and tomato along with sambar. It’s a pretty big dosa and is tummy filling.</p>

            <p class="text-justify pb-5" style="font-size: 105%;">I’d rate this place a 4.2/5. Even if you don’t eat the
                dosa, pav bhaji is a MUST TRY. If you’ve already visited this place, drop in your favourite dish. How
                many stars would you give this restaurant? I would definitely give it 5/5. If not, do drop in to eat the
                special pav bhaji and let me know in the comment section how your first experience was.<br><br>~Muskaan
